Heart\+Pi is a simulation project developed for CS3307 (by Team 40) that models heart health monitoring by combining survey-\/based user inputs with randomized sensor data.

The application features an interactive Qt-\/based GUI to display live heart rate graphs, risk assessments, and additional information such as data logging and email notifications.
