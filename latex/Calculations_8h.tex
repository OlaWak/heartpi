\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Header file for heart health assessment functionality. 

This file declares the function prototype for assessing heart health by computing a risk score based on a \mbox{\hyperlink{classFamilyHealth}{Family\+Health}} object and simulating sensor readings such as heart rate, blood pressure, cholesterol, and ECG.

Assesses heart health and simulates sensor readings. 

This function computes a risk score based on various parameters contained in the \mbox{\hyperlink{classFamilyHealth}{Family\+Health}} object, including age, gender, sleep hours, exercise frequency, family disease history, diet type, and smoking status. It then simulates sensor readings for heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol, and ECG using randomly generated values based on the risk score thresholds.

The thresholds for risk score are used as follows\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Low risk\+: risk score $<$ 10
\item Moderate risk\+: risk score $>$= 10 and $<$ 18
\item High risk\+: risk score $>$= 18
\end{DoxyItemize}

Assesses heart health and simulates sensor readings.

This function calculates a risk score based on various factors extracted from the \mbox{\hyperlink{classFamilyHealth}{Family\+Health}} object. It evaluates the age group, gender, sleep hours, exercise frequency, family disease history, diet type, and smoking status. The risk score is then used to simulate sensor readings for heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol, and ECG using randomly generated values.

The thresholds for risk score are used as follows\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Low risk\+: risk score $<$ 10
\item Moderate risk\+: risk score $>$= 10 and $<$ 18
\item High risk\+: risk score $>$= 18
\end{DoxyItemize}
